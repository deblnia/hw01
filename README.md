## Research 

I spent the early part of the summer working with Karthick Ramakrishnan at [AAPI Data](aapidata.com), and I did research with [Professor Robert Gulotty](http://home.uchicago.edu/~gulotty/index.html) focusing on political economy in American Rust Belts for the rest of the summer. I've been involved with the [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) since my first year.  

## Comedy 

I do two comedy activities on-campus: 

***1. Occam's Razor Comedy Improv*** 

I practice and perform improvisational comedy. 

***2. The Chicago Shady Dealer***

I both write and compile layout for this publication.
